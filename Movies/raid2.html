    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
    Raid 2 isn't a direct retelling of one single true story, but it's inspired by real income tax raids,
    particularly a major one in Uttar Pradesh involving a politician-businessman accused of massive tax 
    fraud, blending real incidents with fictional elements to create the sequel's plot. Director Raj Kumar 
    Gupta aimed for a mix of reality and fiction, unlike the first Raid, which was based more closely on 
    India's longest-ever income tax raid.
