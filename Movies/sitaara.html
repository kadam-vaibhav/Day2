    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
    Sitaare Zameen Par (2025) tells the story of Gulshan Arora (Aamir Khan), a disgraced, cynical basketball 
    coach sentenced to community service for drunk driving, who must train a basketball team of adults with
    intellectual disabilities. Initially resistant, he slowly transforms as he connects with his players,
    learning life lessons about empathy, true strength, and inclusion, realizing they are teaching him more 
    than he's teaching them, culminating in a journey towards a national tournament and personal 
    redemption.
