    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Chhaava tells the epic story of Maratha warrior-king Chhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj, <br>
        son of Shivaji, as he defends his empire against the formidable Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb,  <br>
        focusing on his nine-year struggle, valor, political challenges, and ultimate betrayal and torture, <br>portraying his fight for dharma, kingdom, and refusal to convert. The film, based on Shivaji <br>Sawant's novel, highlights his guerrilla tactics, strong bond with wife Yasubai, internal court <br>conspiracies, and the need for Indian unity,  <br>culminating in his gruesome death but immortalizing him as a heroic figure.
