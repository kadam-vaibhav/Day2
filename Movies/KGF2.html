    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        K.G.F: Chapter 2 continues the epic saga of Rocky (Yash) as he solidifies his brutal reign over the 
        Kolar Gold Fields (KGF), facing powerful new enemies, political threats (like Prime Minister Ramika 
        Sen), and internal struggles, all while fulfilling his promise to his mother and seeking unchallenged 
        power, leading to bloodier battles and a deeper look into his past and vulnerabilities. The film 
        features grander action, heightened stakes, and a clash of powerful forces, with Sanjay Dutt as the 
        menacing antagonist Adheera, Raveena Tandon as the PM, and a narrator continuing the story.
